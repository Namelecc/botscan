Hello, and welcome to BotScan! This is a short guide on how to get started with BotScan.
First, you are going to want to type in the suspicious playerâ€™s username into the username field. Capitalization does not matter. Next, you want to choose the variant. This has to be one of the following, exactly as written, excluding the commas (capitalization matters!): ultraBullet bullet, blitz, rapid, classical, chess960, crazyhouse, antichess, horde, kingOfTheHill, racingKings, threeCheck. It is important that you do this correctly. For speed, write one of the following: ultraBullet, bullet, blitz, rapid, classical. If you are choosing a non-standard variant of chess for the variant input, you need to put a speed. If you are choosing a standard variant of chess for the variant input, you can leave this blank: the code fills it in for you. Lastly, minimum rating: In numerical form, put in the minimum rating of the suspects opponents. If you leave this blank, the code will default to a minimum rating of 0 (everyone). Now you are ready to run the code, so hit the green Submit button. It might take a while to go through the games, so be patient. After the code is done, it should put the games and a coefficient into the scroll box, which you can scroll through. To look at a game, click on it in the scroll box, then hit the green 'Open' button and the game will be opened in your default browser! And you are pretty much done.
