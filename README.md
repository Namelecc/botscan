# botscan

An extension of the original botscan from Phalanx (https://github.com/Namelecc/phalanx/blob/main/Game%20Finders/bot_scan.py). git clone botscan to download, run main.py to use. Goes through games and looks for potentially botted ones. Free to use, open source. Do not use for public shaming purposes.
